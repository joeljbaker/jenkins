# jenkins
Dockerised Jenkins with support for building docker images itself

### What?
This simply takes the vanilla jenkins docker image and builds a docker image that itself has both jenkins and docker installed in it.
Get it?

### Why?
I wanted a docker-run jenkins that could itself build docker images, including itself.
